[GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-actions) provides the flexibility to build automated workflows for the software development lifecycle.

GitHub Actions can be used to automate the workflow of deploying to [Azure Container App](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-apps/).

Let's get started today with a [free Azure account](https://azure.com/free/open-source)!

This repository contains to deploy to Azure Container App. It supports deploying your container image to an Azure Container Instance.

This repository contains the [GitHub Action for Deploying to Azure Container App](./action.yml).

The definition of this GitHub Action is in [action.yml](./action.yml).

# End-to-End Sample Workflows

## Dependencies on other GitHub Actions
* [Azure Login](https://github.com/Azure/login) Login with your Azure Credentials for Authentication. Once login is done, the next set of Azure Actions in the workflow can re-use the same session within the job.

## Azure Service Principal for RBAC
For using any credentials like Azure Service Principal in your workflow, add them as [secrets](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-enivronments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables) in the GitHub Repository and then refer them in the workflow.
1. Download Azure CLI from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest), run `az login` to login with your Azure Credentials.
2. Run Azure CLI command to create an [Azure Service Principal for RBAC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview):
```bash

    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "myApp" --role contributor \
                             --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group} \
                             --sdk-auth
    
    # Replace {subscription-id}, {resource-group} with the subscription, resource group details of the WebApp
    # The command should output a JSON object similar to this:

  {
    "clientId": "<GUID>",
    "clientSecret": "<GUID>",
    "subscriptionId": "<GUID>",
    "tenantId": "<GUID>",
    (...)
  }
```
  * You can further scope down the Azure Credentials to the Web App using scope attribute. For example, 
  ```
   az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "myApp" --role contributor \
                            --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{app-name} \
                            --sdk-auth

  # Replace {subscription-id}, {resource-group}, and {app-name} with the names of your subscription, resource group, and Azure Web App.
  ```
3. Paste the json response from above Azure CLI to your GitHub Repository > Settings > Secrets > Add a new secret > **AZURE_CREDENTIALS**
4. Now in the workflow file in your branch: `.github/workflows/workflow.yml` replace the secret in Azure login action with your secret (Refer to the example below)
